### Building and Installing
Well... seeing as there isn't actually any source in the repository yet, this isn't actually possible at the moment

When we have actually implemented stuff the following will probably apply

**Build system**: CMake to set up build environment then whatever CMake gives you (depends on platform, make for Linux, etc.)

**Dependencies**: 
    [OpenCV 3.0](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
    [Boost 1.58](http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
    [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)

####Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the Project
2. Install dependencies
3. Use CMake to setup the project from the CMake list
4. Compile
